    This website employs VeriSign and industry-standard SSL to provide secure credit card transactions. SSL is a communications protocol for transmitting private information over the internet. It works by encrypting data that is transmitted over the SSL connection. When you place an order, your credit/debit card information is encrypted and then sent over the internet using an SSL connection. No one can read or access the data that is being transmitted.
    We take the risk of internet fraud very seriously. With the volume of fraudulent credit card transactions increasing, we make every effort to ensure all orders are thoroughly checked using the information already supplied. There is a possibility we may contact you to make additional security checks and we ask for your co-operation to enable us to complete them. Fraudulent transactions will not be tolerated by us and such transactions will be reported to the relevant authorities.
    It is important for you to be aware against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Ensure that you log out when you finish using a shared computer.
    Y&E may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates or changes to the terms of this Privacy Policy, the recent version will be posted here on our website.
